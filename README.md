I would need someone to automate the remote selenium setup of an extension (crypto wallet), in order to allow me to be able to scrape data from https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/en/discover

What would need to be done?
1. Enable extension from file in remote (docker) selenium
2. log into extension with user/password
3. log into website https://photon-sol.tinyastro.io/en/discover with given extension/wallet
4. scraping data is not part of this assignment.
